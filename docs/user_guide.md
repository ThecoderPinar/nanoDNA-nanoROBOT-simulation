## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Before using the NanoDNA-NanoROBOT Simulation, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org).

Once Python is installed, you can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
## 2. Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the NanoDNA-NanoROBOT Simulation project from the GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the main simulation script:

```bash
python main.py
   ```
## 3. Simulating Nanorobot Movement <a name="simulating-nanorobot-movement"></a>

The simulation software allows you to simulate the movement of nanorobots in a three-dimensional space. You can specify the number of nanorobots, their initial positions, and movement parameters.

To simulate nanorobot movement:

1. Initialize nanorobot objects with specified DNA sequences and initial positions.
2. Define the movement parameters (e.g., step size, number of steps).
3. Run the simulation to observe the movement of nanorobots.

## 4. Interacting with DNA Sequences <a name="interacting-with-dna-sequences"></a>

In addition to movement, nanorobots can interact with DNA sequences by recognizing and binding to specific sequences. You can specify target DNA sequences and simulate nanorobot interactions based on predefined rules.

To simulate nanorobot interactions with DNA sequences:

1. Define the target DNA sequences.
2. Implement the interaction rules in the simulation software.
3. Run the simulation to observe nanorobot interactions with DNA sequences.

## 5. Visualization <a name="visualization"></a>

The simulation software provides visualization tools to visualize the simulated movement and interactions of nanorobots in three-dimensional space. You can visualize the nanorobot paths, DNA sequences, and interaction events.

To visualize simulation results:

1. Utilize the built-in visualization module.
2. Customize the visualization parameters to suit your requirements.
3. Analyze the visualizations to gain insights into nanorobot behavior.

## 6. Analyzing Simulation Results <a name="analyzing-simulation-results"></a>

After running the simulation, you can analyze the simulation results to evaluate performance and gather insights. You can analyze various metrics such as total distance traveled, average speed, and interaction frequency.

To analyze simulation results:

1. Extract relevant data from the simulation output.
2. Calculate performance metrics and statistics.
3. Interpret the results to draw conclusions and make recommendations.

## 7. Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

If you encounter any issues or errors while using the simulation software, refer to the troubleshooting section of the documentation. Here, you can find common problems and their solutions.
